           <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>I doubt many educators do not use Kahoot in their classrooms.  Kahoot is a fun and interactive way to do a fun quiz using your smartboard.  Kids can log in to the quiz using their device and compete to earn a spot on the leaderboard.  I often use Kahoot as a reward for my students because they love it so much.  During the Pandemic, there were obviously no face to face seminars taking place but many companies created webinars to showcase their products.  I attended the Kahoot Edu Summit virtually in June 2020.  As Kahoot is also one of my favorite sites I was excited to learn more about how to use Kahoot.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>Kahoot is used in our district from Kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade.  Kids simply love playing it.  But, what is very useful about Kahoot is that it can be used as a formative or summative assessment and can give teachers useful data to help drive instruction. You can create your own quiz or use one already made.  There are so many great quizzes made by other teachers on there that you are bound to find something useful.  After watching the Webinar about getting the most out of Kahoot with Carol Salva I learned some new tricks that I am excited to implement in the classroom in the future.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I know my other team members and other teachers in the building enjoy using Kahoot.  I look forward to sharing some of the little tricks learned from the webinar with them and this site can also be used for professional development in the future.   <br/>

       <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>  Through our district professional development, I attended a Backward Design session with one of our curricula directors.  We were to design or improve upon a unit taught in the school year and look to make it better for the following year using technology.<br/>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>I enjoyed this Professional  Development experience as I use “Backward Design” for each unit I teach and this helped provide deeper more insightful questions for our students which we then had to implement on Google Docs, Slides, etc.<br/>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>As this was a full building PD opportunity it was a great platform for everyone to collaborate and share ideas.  For some of our more experienced teachers, it was an opportunity to update some of their older units using technology and fully utilize using Google Apps for education.<br/>
