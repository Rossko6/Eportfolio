      <td width="798"><b> Screencastify </b><br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>  I frequently use the app called Screencastify to show my students how to use technology or I’ll use it to create sub plans if I’m out for whatever reason.  This is a great app to allow my students to watch a video of me showing instructions and sharing my screen with them.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>Using Screencatify allows our more visual learners the opportunity to watch and listen to instructions as opposed to just reading instructions.  This is how I enjoy learning as I am a visual learner also.  It is still useful of course to have written directions for students but the convenience of Screencastify means you can make a quick 2-3 minute video and can share the link with them easily. <br />
 <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I would like to learn more about some of the tools featured on Screencastify that I am not fully comfortable using yet.  I am hoping to speak to our principal about maybe featuring it during one of our technology professional development days and collaborating with other staff members on how to use it better.   <br />        
       
<td width="798"><b>Nearpod</b><br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> This past school year as part of professional development, each grade level was to go on a “field trip” to another grade level to watch another teacher use technology in their classroom.  Basically, in our case 5th-grade teachers went to watch the 4th-grade teachers and vice versa.  We were all required to share what technology we would be using beforehand to allow each teacher to plan something different.  This allowed for each teacher to see firsthand how a  technology they maybe haven’t used before being used in the classroom. <br/>       
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>Nearpod is an online student interactive lesson that can be used to give students an opportunity to fully immerse themselves in a topic.  Nearpod is especially useful for science and social studies lessons.  Teachers can create presentations and add quizzes, videos, pictures, polls, and other web content to enhance the lesson.  You can create a lesson, use some of the free lessons, or buy some lessons from a creator for a small price.  The 4th-grade teachers that came to watch my Nearpod lesson were amazed at what a great resource it was for student engagement and after visiting each other’s classrooms to watch lessons we had a productive discussion afterward where we could ask each other questions to help further learn bout the technology being used. <br/>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> The kids really enjoy Nearpod lessons as it is a fun and interactive way to learn about a topic.  Like most educational websites, there is a membership involved if you want to download and own as many lessons as you want and I hope to discuss this with our principal to see if funds could be made available for a building membership as I think everyone could benefit from this platform. <br/>
