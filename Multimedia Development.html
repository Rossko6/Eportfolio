        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>  I frequently use the app called Screencastify to show my students how to use technology or I’ll use it to create sub plans if I’m out for whatever reason.  This is a great app to allow my students to watch a video of me showing instructions and sharing my screen with them.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>Using Screencatify allows our more visual learners the opportunity to watch and listen to instructions as opposed to just reading instructions.  This is how I enjoy learning as I am a visual learner also.  It is still useful of course to have written directions for students but the convenience of Screencastify means you can make a quick 2-3 minute video and can share the link with them easily. <br />
 <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I would like to learn more about some of the tools featured on Screencastify that I am not fully comfortable using yet.  I am hoping to speak to our principal about maybe featuring it during one of our technology professional development days and collaborating with other staff members on how to use it better.   <br />
