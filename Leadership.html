        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>  This past year I have taken on the role of team leader within our TBT meetings.  Each grade has a leader that collaborates with other grades in the building to discuss the most effective way for teachers to share students’ progress and ultimately collect data to guide instruction.  Our principal asked that we create a Google Doc that helps align building goals with state standards and also shows the assessments used to show student growth.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Many meetings at my workplace would be better suited to an email!  But, the meetings we had discussing each grade level’s needs and collaborating on a suitable way for the entire building to collect data the same way, lead us to create the TBT form that was well received by colleagues. <br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>I am quite happy to continue this role moving forward as I enjoyed learning from other grade levels.  Each grade brings different challenges and needs and it was an enjoyable experience learning from other grade levels.<a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPm8c8eDpF4b1LOdbzM_YDK3ipKXRiheyw_gG5E8m-8/edit?usp=sharing> Click Here to View</a><br />

   <td width="798"><b>CICO Coordinator </b><br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>During the 2018-2019 school year, I took on the role of CICO (Check-in/Check-out) Coordinator.  This involved creating a Google Form looking for teachers who would volunteer to mentor a child in our building that perhaps was struggling at school.  The student would stop by their assigned teacher’s homeroom in the morning before going to theirs to simply “check-in” with the teacher to share how they were doing in class.  This was simply about giving the student another adult in the building giving them praise and support and encouraging good habits from the student.<br />  

<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>I enjoyed putting this together as I feel some of the students in our classrooms just need that extra adult support.  It is challenging to get some students to give their best effort with their academics but the additional praise and support certainly helped some of the students.<br /> 

     <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>This program is not in place at my new building but I would be willing to implement it as there are definitely students that would benefit from this.<a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRtnpa05_mYBvf1Hp3bYqMogRkkun4XhrkLP0xPZY2oNqb5g/viewform?usp=sf_link>Click Here to View</a> <br />
