<td width="798"><b>Instructional Design Project </b><br />
        This project is an analysis report for a fifth-grade class at Huntington Elementary located in Brunswick, OH. The objective of the report is to design instruction to increase motivation in reading and writing for the fifth grade students. <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5yfqfNdS14ddWek5_Zfuo-iKsPmqpVjQFrvX62RFOs/edit?usp=sharing> Click Here to View</a> <br />

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> At the beginning of each school year, I have my students complete a needs assessment which highlights what kind of learner they are.  My students are either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.  Or they may be a combination of two.  I do this at the beginning of every school year to better know how exactly my students learn and allow me to properly differentiate my instruction.  I simply use the quiz below for the students to complete and I keep track of what kind of learner each student is.<br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> It is important to meet the needs of all learners as our students are not all the same.  If I stood at the front of my classroom and lectured every day I could possibly meet the needs of my auditory kids but I would lose interest from the rest very quickly.  This needs assessment helps drive instruction throughout the school year and helps me get to know my students better. <br/>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>This needs assessment is a common practice for teachers and an important start to learning about our students.  I would like to further discuss this topic with other teachers to see what kind of process they use to distinguish between the different types of learners they have in their classroom as its something that shouldn’t be overlooked. <br/>

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>As part of our weekly TBT meetings we were required to share a technology that has been useful to you in the classroom.  Kristin Jones and I had made a presentation on using Plickers in the Elementary Classroom as part of our IT coursework and were able to use this presentation to share how to use Plickers with fellow staff members.  Plickers is a great formative assessment tool to gauge understanding after a lesson.  It is also fun for the kids to use and all the tools you need are your smartphone and your computer connected to the smartboard. <br/>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>As educators, we are always looking for quick and simple ways to collect data and check for understanding.  Plickers is a great free tool that can help with this.  Students can receive feedback in “real-time” and correct their misunderstandings. <br/>        
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>I still have not heard of too many teachers in my building using this platform which surprises me.  I feel that maybe I enjoy using Plickers too often but each teacher has their own way of doing things.  I think with little perseverance teachers would really enjoy using Plickers in their classroom. <br/>
