      <td width="798"><b>Remind App </b><br />
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> In previous years teaching I have used a platform called Class Dojo to communicate with my student’s parents.  This past school year, our central office informed us we are no longer using Class Dojo but recommended using the Remind App.  At first, I wasn’t a fan of this app as I felt it was a little dull and not user friendly.  But, once I got the hang of it, I found the Remind App to be a good resource to effectively communicate with our students’ families.  We particularly enjoyed using the app when we were on our class trip to Camp Nuhop near Mohican State Park in March.   The fifth-grade teachers would send multiple pictures a day to the parents just showing them the activities the kids were doing during the day.  Parents could like the pictures and comment on them.  The app was well-received by our families.<br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>It seems more and more buildings/classrooms in our district are using the Remind app which is a good thing as it displays uniformity across the district and it means students and parents are not having to download a different app every school year.  Continued use of the app means they also don't have to learn how to use a new one.  This app is also great for quick reminders about due work or assignments and students and parents can view the class feed for any important information they are searching for.<br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span>This app is very useful and has been a great way of communicating with families.  I would like to see this being used all across the district so parents are not using/downloading different apps each year for communication purposes.  This app is much more convenient than having to send group emails and can be used directly from your cell phone.<a href=https://youtu.be/1BufFR4Fado> Click Here to View</a>

        <td width="798"><b>Google Classroom</b><br />        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>A few years ago our district adopted the Google platform for emails, docs, sheets, etc.  I truly like all the Google Apps for education as I feel they are very easy to use and implement in the classroom.  One of the best tools I enjoy from Google is using Google Classroom.  I find Google Classroom to be like a class website but a much simpler platform to use.  I relied upon Google Classroom heavily during the pandemic to post all assignments and kids could upload their work there efficiently.<br />  
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>As students across the district are familiar with Google Classroom it provides continuity each year as our students are familiar with how to use it and it means students are not having to learn how to use a new program or website each year.  Having worked in two elementary schools in our district I have seen even our kindergartners and first graders use Google Classroom appropriately. <br />        
<span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> This continued use of Google Classroom allows for smooth transitions for each school year.  There is nothing to be added or adjusted with Google Classroom, it is a great “class hub” and central point for our students.  Students can post questions on assignments for the benefit of all and the site can be used as a discussion board also. <br />
